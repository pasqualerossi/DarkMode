# DarkMode

A quick apperance toggle for the 42 school computers, created as a solution to the settings reverting after logging out.

Due to the limits of the 42 user accounts I have made this script an easy to access button rather than an automatic login item.

I will be looking into adding other prefrences such as mouse tracking speed and scroll direction, as long as my user permissions allow it. With these potential implementations you'll get access to your desired prefrences with one quick launch of the script.

### Getting Started
Use your preferred repository cloning method:
HTTPS, SSH, GitHub CLI or instead download the ZIP.

Open the repositories folder and move the script "DarkMode" onto your Desktop.

### Usage
Double click the script to switch between light and dark mode. Once completed, the application for the script will immediately close.

Ideally this script lives on the desktop so the apperance settings can easily be toggled after logging in.
